               <p>Each issue of CheckPoint® brings your customers nutrition and management information to help keep their cows in condition, their calves growing, and their bottom line healthy. </p>

                    <h4><strong>Cover Crops, Good for Soil, Good for Livestock</strong></h4>
                    <p>The concept of a cover crop is simple. You plant a primary crop for harvest, then a cover crop at, or just before harvest to protect the soil from erosion and reduce loss of nutrients from leaching and runoff.  But cover crops can also be “just the ticket” for economical fall grazing of cattle.  Your cattle customers will learn the how and why.</p>

                    <h4><strong>Reduce Stress in Weaning Pens to Produce Healthy, Marketable Calves</strong></h4>
                    <p>Learning to eat and drink, being separated from Mom, and adapting to a new environment make weaning one of the most stressful events in a calf’s life. Reducing that stress is crucial to calf health—and future performance and productivity. Warren Gill, Ph.D., director, School of Agribusiness and Agriscience at Middle Tennessee State University, talks about reducing stress, especially in weaning pens.</p>

                    <p>Until recently Scott Kill and Brent Blythe were primarily grain farmers, raising corn, soybeans and wheat on their farm in Spencerville, Ohio.  Then, through their partnership, K &amp; B Cattle, they launched a new endeavor. They began feeding out about 420 head of cattle a year.  They use Purina products, and stated, “We’ve had good luck achieving an average daily gain of 3 lbs. per day. . . .”</p>

These two brothers own Gettinger Chiangus in Rushville, Ind., where they breed and raise show cattle and beef calves, plus grow corn and soybeans. They feed Purina products and claim, “The overall quality of the cattle has proven the Purina products do what they’re supposed to.”</p>
